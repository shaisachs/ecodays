This site will provide environmental groups, and particularly their digital content creators, with a preview of upcoming holidays and other milestones in the calendar - ranging from Earth Day to the birthday of the Clean Air Act.

The calendar will be powered by an API that reads from a static Github Pages data directory. Data collection is already in progress! See the [current list of dates](https://github.com/shaisachs/ecodays/blob/master/docs/_data/holidays.yml), and send a pull request if there are some you'd like to add.

More to come! Expected completion: Earth Day 2018.
