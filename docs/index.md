# EcoDays

## An API-powered content calendar for environmental groups

This site will provide environmental groups, and particularly their digital content creators, with a preview of upcoming holidays and other milestones in the calendar - ranging from Earth Day to the birthday of the Clean Air Act.

The calendar will be powered by an API that reads from a static Github Pages data directory.

More to come! Expected completion: Earth Day 2018.
